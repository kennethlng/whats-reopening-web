# whats-reopening-web

[WhatsReopening.com](https://whatsreopening.com) is a community-driven website I'm currently developing to track places (establishments, geographic locations, and prominent points of interest), their current status, and when they're reopening during COVID-19. This repo is just for the front-end. The backend functions can be found [here](https://github.com/narwhal-sightings/narwhal-cloud-functions).

## Stack

I'm using React for the front-end, Cloud Firestore for the NoSQL database, and Cloud Functions for the backend functions. Submitted places are verified using Google Maps Places API.
