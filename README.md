# whats-reopening-web

WhatsReopening.com is a community-driven website I'm developing to track places, their current status, and when they're reopening during COVID-19. 

## Stack

I'm using React for the front-end, Cloud Firestore for the NoSQL database, and Cloud Functions for the backend functions. Submitted places are verified using Google Maps Places API.
